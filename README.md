# Cover Letter Auto Filler
 A Python app to automate cover letter creation based on templates.

##How it works:

First, you need to create a template cover letter named "template.docx" and ensure that it is in the same directory as the script.

Here is an example:

The script will replace the following keywords:

<ul>
 <li>DATE</li>
 <li>YOURNAME</li>
 <li>COMPANY</li>
 <li>POSITION</li>
 </ul>
 
 You will be prompted at first run to enter your name.  After that it will automatically fill in the name and date fields.  The only input you will need is the name of the company and the position you are applying for.
 
 The script creates a folder and subfolder in the same directory it is located.  The subfolder is named based on the current date and the folder is named Cover Letters.  This helps you keep the files somewhat organized.
